Put the files of this program directly in your module system.
For standard module system (where all the files are in the same folder) put the files where module_info.py is.
For subfoldered module system, put the files in the root folder of the module system (program will look for .\module\info.py, where . is the location of the program).

Requires Python v2.7 to run. Tested on Windows.
